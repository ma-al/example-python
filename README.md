# Summary
This is an an example Python code repository for members of Australia's [Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre](https://cybersecuritycrc.org.au/). This was featured in the CSCRC seminar on "Software Best Practices" on 2021-08-26.

It is intended to:
- show expected structure of Python code
- encourage code reuse, sharing and safe storage
- ensure work is accessible for CSCRC legal team
- show how to use simple tools like `pylint`


# Code Style & Quality
Researchers should strive for code quality that matches industry and community standards. Doing so leads to better science outcomes and easier sharing of knowledge.

If commercialisation is a criteria, writing good code from the start leads to faster prototyping and outcomes.

```bash
cd example-python # go to repo root
pylint example_python

# if pylint is not found
pip install pylint
```

Above conducts a check locally on your machine, using the included [pylintrc file](./pylintrc).
