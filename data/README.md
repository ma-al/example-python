# Notes
This folder is here as an advisory only.
- meant to demonstrate an appropriate repository structure
- in general, this folder should *not* be committed and pushed to your repository
- the [`.gitignore`](../.gitignore) will stop commits from anything in here

If you have a need to version large amounts of data (binary or text), some exceptions can be made.
- Please consult the nearest engineer 👷🏻‍♀️
